# AutonomousDrones
This is a group looking to build and document fully autonomous drones. 
We'll be using Ardupilot and some Pixhawk controller ( I am using Cube Blue ).

The plan is to use Python, running on a rasperry pi ( trying the zero to start, it might not have enough power ) , connected to the Pixhawk, and using the [Dronekit](https://dronekit.io/) library for high level commands like 'Fly to these GPS coordinates'.

# Documentation 

The goal of this project is to document a fully functional autononmous drone build.  Here is the current parts list

* CUBE BLUE FLIGHT CONTROLLER ( TODO:  What model is it - waiting on delivery )
* HERE2 GPS AND COMPASS (2 INTERNAL 1 EXTERNAL)
* WI-FI TELEMETRY ( TODO:  What brand is it - waiting on delivery )
* SUNNYSKY 800KV BRUSHLESS MOTORS
* 3DR FRAME
